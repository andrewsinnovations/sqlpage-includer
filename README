--textExtensions - Additional comma-separated text file extensions (default: .txt,.html,.js,.css,.json,.md,.sql)
--skipDelete    - Skip deleting the output directory if it already exists
--childProcess  - Command to spawn a child process with the output directory as the working directory (default: sqlpage)
--includeRoot   - Root directory for includes (default: input directory)
--maxRecursion  - Maximum depth for resolving includes (default: 10)
